This is the content of my blog which resides at "miha.hribar.info":http://miha.hribar.info. I used to run my site using a custom built CMS but after a couple of years of procrastination I decided to restart it and what better tool to use than "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll and "github pages":http://pages.github.com.
