Projects
========

I'm always tinkering with various ideas. You can see a list of my public
projects and contributions on [Github](https://github.com/mihahribar).

Toshl Finance
-------------

Currently most of my days are spent working on
[Toshl](https://toshl.com), a [500 Startup](http://500.co) company,
headquartered in Mountain View, California. Toshl started as a spinoff
project from our parent company [3FS](http://3fs.si) in 2009. I'm the
CTO and a Co-Founder of the campany.

</ul>

Editorial Template
------------------

[Editorial Template](http://editorialtemplate.com) is a reponsive
Wordpress template designed specifically for digital magazines. I was
fortunate enough to be part of the team with the insanely talented
[Natan Nikolic](http://natannikolic.com/) and [Matjaz
Korosec](http://matjazkorosec.com/), but have since moved on to focus
exclusively on Toshl.

Razvijalec.si
-------------

[Razvijalec.si](http://razvijalec.si) is a local developer online
magazine/group. It has been in the works for quite some time now and
will hopefully go live in one form or another soon.
