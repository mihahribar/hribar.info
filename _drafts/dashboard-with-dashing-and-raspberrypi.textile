If you've ever visited a startup office chances are you saw their dashboard with various "KPIs":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator. Anyone that enters can have a glance at the stats to see how your business is doing.

"Shopify":http://www.shopify.com opensourced their awesome dashboard framework called "dashing":http://shopify.github.io/dashing/ which they use to showcase various dashboards on tvs around the office. It's built using Sinatra, batman.js, d3 and SSE. It is very easy to set up.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install dashing
{% endhighlight %}

You can then setup various jobs that periodically pull stats from various locations and then push them to all your dashboards. The "github":https://github.com/Shopify/dashing repository has a list of some awesome "widgets":https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets you can use in your dashboard project.
