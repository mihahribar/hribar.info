h1. Projects

I'm currently not available for any side projects.

h2. Toshl Finance

Currently most of my days are spent working on "Toshl":https://toshl.com, a "500 Startup":http://500.co company, headquartered in Mountain View, California. Toshl started as a spinoff project from our parent company "3FS":http://3fs.si in 2009. I'm the CTO and a Co-Founder of the campany.

* "Toshl Live":https://github.com/toshl/toshl-live - Example of how to track live locations using google maps. We use it to show "live sync locations":http://toshl.com/live/.

h2. Editorial Template

"Editorial Template":http://editorialtemplate.com is a reponsive Wordpress template designed specifically for digital magazines. I was fortunate enough to be part of the team with "Natan Nikolič":http://natannikolic.com/ and "Matjaž Korošec":http://matjazkorosec.com/, but have since moved on to focus exclusively on Toshl.

h2. Razvijalec.si

"Razvijalec.si":http://razvijalec.si is a local developer online magazine/group. It has been in the works for quite some time now and will hopefully go live in one form or another soon.
