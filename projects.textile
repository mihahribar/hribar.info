	<li>C++</li>
	<li>R</li>
	<li>Git</li>
</ul>

Currently most of my days are spent working on "Toshl":https://toshl.com, a "500 Startup":http://500.co company, headquartered in Mountain View, California. Toshl started as a spinoff project from our parent company "3FS":http://3fs.si in 2009. I'm the CTO and a Co-Founder of the campany.

"Editorial Template":http://editorialtemplate.com is a reponsive Wordpress template designed specifically for digital magazines. I was fortunate enough to be part of the team with the insanely talented "Natan Nikolic":http://natannikolic.com/ and "Matjaz Korosec":http://matjazkorosec.com/, but have since moved on to focus exclusively on Toshl.

h2. Razvijalec.si

"Razvijalec.si":http://razvijalec.si is a local developer online magazine/group. It has been in the works for quite some time now and will hopefully go live in one form or another soon.
