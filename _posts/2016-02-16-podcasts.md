My daily commute lasts about 1 hour. I grow tired of listening to the radio or listening to music. So I listen to podcasts.

I've gotten into many conversations about which podcasts I listen to, so from now on, I'll just point people to this article (yeah, just like you).

## Technical

I try to keep up with the ever changing world of tech and have found that podcasts are a nice way of doing just that.

* Under the Radar; Marco Arment, David Smith
* Magpie Talk Show; Sam Newman
* The Ruby Rogues; Charles Max Wood
* Software Engineering Radio
* Javascript Jabber; Charles Max Wood
* The iPhreaks Show; Charles Max Wood
* Hanselminutes; Scott Hanselman
* The Changelog

## Startup

You might say that a lot of the technical podcasts do deal with startup life, but there is only one true entreperneour podcast on my list.

* Dorm Room Tycoon; William Channer

## Non-technical

* The Sceptics' Guide to the Universe; Dr. Steven Novella
* No Such Thing As A Fish; The QI Elves
* Serial
* Star Talk Radio; Niel deGrasse Tyson
* TED Radio Hour

## NBA

I'm a huge NBA junkie. And I have to get my weekly fix of NBA news and rumours. Call it my guilty pleasure.

* NBA Lockdown
* The Vertical Podcast with JJ Reddick; JJ Reddick

## Slovenian podcasts

* Številke, Marko Jerič
* Odbita Do Bita
* Frekvenca X
* Glave
