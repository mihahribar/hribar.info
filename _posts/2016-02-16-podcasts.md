description: I listen to a lot of podcasts on my daily commute and walks. Here are my current subscriptions.

My daily commute lasts about 1 hour and I quickly tend to grow tired of listening to the radio. So I listen to podcasts. Lots of them. I listen to every show at 1.5x speedup, which did take a while to get up to, but has become second nature now. In fact, if I listen to a podcast at a normal speed, it just sounds plain weird now.

I've gotten into many conversations about which podcasts I listen to, so from now on, I'll just point people to this article (yeah, just like you).

_Note: The star (*) next to the podcast indicates I never miss a show. If I see it pop into my podcatcher (which is Instacast these days) I will most likely stop and listen to it immediately._

## Technical

I try to keep up with the ever changing world of tech and have found that podcasts are a nice way of doing just that.

## Startup

You might say that a lot of the technical podcasts do deal with startup life, but there is only one true entreperneour podcast on my list.

## Non-technical

To get away from the creepy crawlies, erm tech news overload, I splice in a few non-technical/science podcasts.

## NBA

I'm a huge NBA junkie. And I have to get my weekly fix of NBA news and rumours. Call it my guilty pleasure.

* [NBA Lockdown](http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=3634017) *
* [The Vertical Podcast with JJ Reddick](http://sports.yahoo.com/author/jj-redick/)

## Slovenian podcasts

Good to keep an eye on what the locals are up to.
