It's been a couple of months since "we(3FS)":http://www.3fs.si/ moved into our new offices, but now they are finally finished and last week "a couple of photos were taken(3FS office photos on Flickr)":http://www.flickr.com/photos/20993671@N08/sets/72157608619116396/.

The interior design was done by our own Jana Rot, the interior graphic design was done by the "Zek crew(ZEK)":http://zek.si and the phots were taken by Jaka Vinsek. It is more than obvious that everybody involved did their work with passion.

My part of the office can be seen on the following image. And yes, the couch is used very often.

You can only imagine what our next offices will look like. _Google who?_
