[CSS Mastery](http://www.cssmastery.com), written by [Andy
Budd](http://www.andybudd.com) of [Clearleft](http://www.clearleft.com)
fame, is by far one of the best CSS books I've recently had the pleasure
of reading. Written for the bit more savvy web developers, wich means
the author does not beat about the bush and gets down and dirty fairly
quick. CSS is explained in much more detail, clearing up quite a few
cloudy topics, well at least for me.

The author realizes that while CSS is a relatively easy technology to
learn, it is that much more difficult to master. Especially with so many
different browsers, wich is why the book also contains two whole
chapters devoted to finding and fixing bugs as they arise. As you might
have guessed, most of the bugs and fixes revolve around Internet
Explorer, from older versions to Mac versions.

The final two chapters of the book are case studies of two sites hand
crafted by high profile web developers [Cameron
Moll](http://www.cameronmoll.com) and [Simon
Collison](http://www.collylogic.com).

I tried to find a better way of convincing you that the book is well
worth the read, but I belive the quote on the cover of the book says it
all:

> Andy Budd not only clearly understands and is able to teach the
> underlying technologies and contemporary methods used in CSS design,
> but his knowledge of cross-browser support issues is unparalleled.<br/>
> - Molly E. Holzschlag

High praise, and rightly so. In my oppinion CSS Mastery should be on the
required reading list of each and every web developer. You are bound to
find at least a few things you didn't know before.
