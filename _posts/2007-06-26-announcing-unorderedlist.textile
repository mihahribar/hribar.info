It gives me great pleasure to announce the release of my newest creation - "unorderedlist.net":http://unorderedlist.net. For now the site will function mainly as a *local web development job board*, with other content bound to emerge soon.

This project has been a long time coming, as I have contemplated implementing a decent job board on several occasions. After recently talking things over with a few of the local developers, I decided the time is more than right.

All of the job ads can be added free of charge, but for companies which feel they are in desperate need of new blood I have set up a payed service (the selected add remains on the top of the list for a month) for a small fee.

Also an API is in the works which will enable users to add, fetch and show only the ads they want to display.

T-shirts with the UL (unorderedlist) logo have been designed but are currently out of stock. A new batch should be available fairly soon. For now you can "admire them on flickr":http://flickr.com/photos/mihahribar/sets/72157594277637458/.
