It's been another busy year for me, with loads of changes, but two of the biggest came right at the end.

I have decided to leave my position with Dhimahi and have joined a growing power called Thirdframestudios. There were many reasons for this, but the biggest was the need for change and the opportunity to work on different platforms and languages. All in all I will always cherish my time spent with Dhimahi and its crew.

My time at the university is coming to an end and this seemed to be the best time to start getting on my own two feet. I have moved out from my parents house and into an apartment with my long time girlfriend Petra. We moved just in time to spend our first Christmas at our own place. It's not a big apartment but it'll do, for now.

All that is left to say is have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year 2008. May it be as fruitful as the last.
