Hell yeah :) I bought one too. And the name suits it best. It really is impossibly small. I couldn't belive my eyes when I saw it, let alone held it in my hand. At 64 grams it feels like carying next to nothing. Amazing.

I got the "2gb black":http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/ version and this little big player has a load of "features":http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/features.html . The thing I fell in love with right away is the Click Wheel. Impossibly simple. All it takes is a few minutes to get used to it.

bq. Take everything you love about iPod and shrink it. Now shrink it again. With 2GB (500 songs) and 4GB (1,000 songs) models starting at $199, the pencil-thin iPod nano packs the entire iPod experience into an impossibly small design. So small, it will take your music places you never dreamed of.

The only things I'm afraid of is loosing the damn thing. Well that and the fact that they tend to get scrached up pretty quick. I heard that Apple is shipping the new ones with protecting cases to avoid law suits. But other than that this "seems":http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/nano.ars/1 to be one hard nut to crack open :)
